// Objects here:

/**
 * In JavaScript everything is an Object.
 * Objects are a complex data type in JavaScript.
 * Object is a key-value or name-value pair.
 * Object can store any kind of data types as key-value pair.
 * Objects consist of properties and can have methods.
 * Object is declared using curly braces {}.
 * Properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.
 * Objects can be created using object literal syntax, constructors, or classes.

let arr = ['name','Rohan',2,3,4] // check the type of this array.

function add(a,b){

Functions in JavaScript are considered "first-class citizens," meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned as values.

let obj = {
    name : "bhabesh", 
    age : 27,
    city: "Mangaldai"
}
